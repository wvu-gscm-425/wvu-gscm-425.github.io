### HD Food Processing Plant

HD is a food processing plant that manufactures buns and frankfurters for hot dogs. The plant has the following constraints:

- They can grind a maximum of 201 pounds of flour per week, with each bun requiring 0.1 pound of flour
- They receive 800 pounds of pork product weekly, with each frankfurter requiring 0.25 pound
- They have 5 full-time employees (40 hours each per week), with each frankfurter requiring 3 minutes of labor and each bun requiring 2 minutes
- Each frankfurter yields a profit of $0.88, and each bun yields a profit of $0.33

Formulate this as an LP model and solve it using both Excel Solver and Python with Gurobi to determine how many frankfurters and buns HD should produce to maximize profit.

Lab Assignment: HD Food Processing Plant
For your lab assignment, you will analyze the HD Food Processing Plant problem. This processing plant manufactures buns and frankfurters for hot dogs with the following operational constraints:

They can grind a maximum of 201 pounds of flour per week, with each bun requiring 0.1 pound of flour
They receive 800 pounds of pork product weekly, with each frankfurter requiring 0.25 pound
They have 5 full-time employees (40 hours each per week = 12,000 minutes total), with each frankfurter requiring 3 minutes of labor and each bun requiring 2 minutes
Each frankfurter yields a profit of $0.88, and each bun yields a profit of $0.33

Part A: Problem Identification
Compare this problem to the Wyndor Glass Co. problem discussed in class. What similarities and differences do you observe in terms of structure, constraints, and objective?
Part B: Information Collection and Interpretation
Construct a table following the format used for the Wyndor Glass Co. problem (Table 3.1), identifying both the products and the resources with their corresponding values.
Part C: Model Formulation
Formulate this as a complete linear programming model. Clearly define your decision variables, objective function, and all constraints.
Part D: Solution with Excel Solver
Implement your model in Excel and solve it using Solver. Include screenshots or exports of your Excel solution showing:

The Solver parameters you used
The optimal solution values
The constraint values (used vs. available)
The objective function value

Part E: Modified Problem - Reduced Pork Supply
Due to a problem with the supplier, the weekly available quantity of pork product has to be reduced to 750 pounds. How would the optimal solution change (if at all)? Adjust your model and re-solve using Excel Solver.
Part F: Modified Problem - Equal Profit Margins
Based on your solution from Part E, how would the optimal solution change if the profit of each bun increased to $0.88 (equal to frankfurters)? Adjust your model and re-solve using Excel Solver.
Part G: Graphical Solution (Optional - Extra Credit)
Use the graphical method to solve the problems in parts D, E, and F. You can draw the figures either manually or using desmos.com. Your graphs should show:

The feasible region
All constraint lines
The objective function contours
The optimal solution points

For each graph, indicate the coordinates of the optimal solution and the corresponding objective function value.
