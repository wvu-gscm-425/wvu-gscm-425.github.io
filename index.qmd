## Course Description

This course offers a deep dive into supply chain network design, guiding students through the process of formulating real-world supply chain problems, gathering and validating data, and applying mathematical programming techniques to find optimal solutions. Students will develop basic yet practical Python programming skills to use Gurobiâ€™s optimizer and will also leverage Excel Solver for comparative analysis. Core topics include facility location, transportation and transshipment models, multi-objective and scenario-based optimization, and sensitivity analysis in the face of uncertainty. Emphasis is placed on the practical implementation of these tools and the communication of results in a managerial context.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Demonstrate Fundamental Python Skills**: Use Python effectively for data handling and basic scripting in preparation for optimization tasks.
2. **Formulate and Solve Supply Chain Network Problems**: Model and solve facility location, transportation, and other network design challenges using both Gurobi and Excel Solver.
3. **Evaluate and Compare Optimization Tools**: Interpret results produced by different solvers, comparing solution quality, run times, and applicability in real-world supply chain scenarios.
4. **Apply Advanced Analysis Techniques**: Incorporate scenario analysis, multi-objective optimization, and sensitivity testing to account for uncertainty and trade-offs in decision making.
5. **Communicate and Collaborate**: Work in teams to analyze data, develop optimization models, and present solution insights and recommendations to stakeholders.
